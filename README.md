# SuiMate Universe AI Agents:<br>AIdeniyi + SuiTrivia + SuiTipper

SuiMate's vision is to become a trusted companion for every Web3 beginner, guiding them through the world of Web3 while educating them on Web3, DeFi, and blockchain concepts. To achieve this, we are developing a series of AI agents designed to engage and interact with users. The current three agents are just the beginning.


We originally planned to integrate all features to [AIdeniyi](https://x.com/aideniyi) but found that this would cause the agent to hit the rate limit easily. Therefore, we created three agents separately as follows:

- **[AIdeniyi](https://x.com/Aideniyi)**: A virtual version of MystenLabs' co-founder that responds to users' questions about the Sui ecosystem and occasionally gives away rewards to those who interact with it.  
- **[SuiTrivia](https://x.com/SuiTrivia)**: An AI agent that asks questions about the Sui ecosystem, challenging users to respond. Those who answer well have a chance to win rewards.  
- **[SuiTipper](https://x.com/SuiTipper)**: An infrastructure AI agent that handles the financial transactions for the above two agents, managing wallets for X users and AI agents.

Additionally, we have developed various infrastructure components related to AI agents, including:  
- [A documentation scraper and database for the Sui ecosystem](https://github.com/SuiMate-AI/docs_scraper), which updates daily by collecting thousands of relevant data points. This enables AI Agents to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate high-quality content. We plan to open access to this via an API.
- [GiftDrop xWallet](https://giftdrop.io/xwallet): A easy-to-connect third party wallet custody solution for X AI agents and users.

We will explain each of the infra and agents in detail at the following sections:
